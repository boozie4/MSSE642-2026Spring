# Discussion — Week 3 (GRADED)

**Due:** Sunday (end of week). We will discuss this theme in class on Thursday.

## Assignment #1 — Status Report

Did you get your personal pen testing lab set up? Describe the current status, setup steps you completed, and any remaining tasks.

## Group Project — Interactions

Describe in detail the interactions you have had with the group for the group project this week (meetings, decisions, assigned tasks, blockers, etc.).

## Problems and Resolutions

What problems have you run into this week, and how did you (or will you) solve them?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have successfully setup my personal pen testing lab using VirtualBox. I have a Kali VM set up as well as a Metasploitable VM. I did perform the port scan on the metaploitable VM. 

I admittedly have not had much interaction regarding the group project. I need to make more time to work on this. 

I would say I did not really run into any issues this week. The directions for setting up the two different VMs were straightforward and easy to follow. I just need to take more time to utilize them and practice using Kali.
