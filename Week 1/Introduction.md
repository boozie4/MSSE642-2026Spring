# Introduction

## About Me

Hey everyone! My name is **Erik Boozell**. I currently work as a **NOC Technician** for a Satellite Communications company based out of Lake Geneva, WI. I am a little more than halfway done with my masters program here at Regis and am very much looking forward to this class.

## Interests & Family

I work full time, coach youth soccer, and play indoor soccer. I am married with three boys, ages 8, 4, and 2. They definitely keep me on my toes!
