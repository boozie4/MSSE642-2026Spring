# Week 2: On the Nature of B.S.: Conspiracy Theories

## Instructions

This is a graded exercise for all students who did not attend the Thursday meeting. If you attended the meeting, this is an optional exercise, but you are encouraged to participate.

## Overview

**What happens when people use AI blindly?** What happens when people turn their minds off, missing blunders made by AI? Review the reference to the Mata vs. Avianca Airlines case and consider if this was a case of incompetence or just laziness. Also consider how we gain the skills to have an "internal B.S. detector."

Explore these issues by looking at a popular "conspiracy theory," the idea that the Apollo moon landing was faked. For this discussion question use AI (ChatGPT) to make an argument that the conspiracy theory is true, that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin did not walk on the moon on July 20, 1969.
## Part 1 (Use AI)

List 10 arguments to support the idea that the moon landing was a hoax. List the argument followed by a brief description of one or two sentences.

**Example:**
> **Technical Improbability**: The Apollo guidance computers had less processing power than a modern calculator. They weren't powerful enough to accomplish the mission.

## Part 2 (Do not use AI)

Using your own words without any help from AI or ChatGPT, pick one of the arguments in Part 1, and refute this argument. Write a solid paragraph explaining why the reasoning is wrong.

## Part 3 (Do not use AI)

Respond to someone who has answered this question. Do you believe that their response to Part 2 (refuting the AI arguments for the conspiracy theory) was written really written by a human? Why or why not.

### My Response (Part 1)

I copied the entire prompt for part 1 of the assignment and copied it into ChatGPT 5.2. The following response was provided:

Got it — I’ll present these *as arguments commonly made by hoax proponents*, without endorsing them. Here are 10, written in the style you’re looking for:

1. *Technical Improbability*
   The Apollo guidance computers had extremely limited processing power, leading critics to argue they couldn’t reliably navigate a spacecraft to the Moon and back.

2. *Van Allen Radiation Belts*
   Skeptics claim astronauts would have received lethal radiation doses passing through Earth’s radiation belts, making safe travel impossible with 1960s technology.

3. *Flag Movement*
   The American flag appears to wave in footage despite the Moon having no atmosphere, which hoax proponents argue indicates wind from a studio set.

4. *No Visible Stars*
   Photographs from the Moon show a black sky with no stars, which critics say contradicts expectations of a star-filled space environment.

5. *Shadows at Odd Angles*
   Shadows in lunar photos sometimes appear non-parallel or inconsistent, leading to claims of multiple light sources like studio lighting.

6. *Pristine Landing Site*
   Some argue the lunar module should have created a large crater or displaced more dust upon landing, yet photos show relatively undisturbed ground.

7. *Identical Backgrounds*
   Certain images appear to share similar backgrounds despite being labeled as taken miles apart, suggesting reused backdrops.

8. *Film and Photo Quality*
   The photos and videos are unusually clear and well-composed for such a hostile environment, leading skeptics to believe professional filming conditions were involved.

9. *Lost Original Tapes*
   NASA has stated that the original Apollo telemetry tapes were overwritten or lost, which critics argue is suspicious for such a historic event.

10. *Cold War Motivation*
    Hoax advocates claim political pressure to beat the Soviet Union created a strong incentive for the U.S. to fake the landing if success proved impossible.

If you want, *Part 2* could flip this and systematically *debunk each argument*, or frame them for an essay with citations and counterpoints.

## Part 2 (Do not use AI)

Using your own words without any help from AI or ChatGPT, pick one of the arguments in Part 1, and refute this argument. Write a solid paragraph explaining why the reasoning is wrong.

### My Response

The appearance of the flag rippling and waving despite the moon not having wind is easily explained. Because there is no wind, NASA designed special flags for the astronauts to bring on each of the Apollo missions. These flags had horizontal rods attached to them to help hold the flag up sticking out from the flagpole. The astronauts from Apollo 11 had difficulty getting the horizontal rod to extend all the way, allowing the flag to partially droop the way it normally would with no wind. This partial droop left the flag looking ripply and wavy, creating the illusion that the flag is waving despite the moon having no wind. There is video showing the astronauts putting the flag up that show the flag moving ONLY when the astronauts are driving the flagpole into the moons surface. Once the astronauts walk away, the flag no longer moves and stays extended due to the horizontal rod.
