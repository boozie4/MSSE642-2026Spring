## My Response

I did not really know that vibe coding was a think until this class. Obviously I am aware of different AI tools and how helpful they can be. I know people who have used AI to help with coding but asking AI how to code specific things. I also have used AI to help with minor things when building software, mostly for personal projects. As I have discussed previously, I was recently allowed to work on rebuilding a website the company I work for owns. Coding and developing is not in my job description or considered duties that I should prioritize, so the time spend working on this website has been minimal so far. However, I have used AI and participated in vibe coding for this task. It is impressive how quickly what I am trying to accomplish can be completed. 

I am still relatively new to coding, so even things that I know and recognize in code still take me time to think of when I am actually writing the code. So something simple, like linking a different webpage to a clickable button, I could easily figure out, but telling GitHub Copilot precisely what I need accomplishes this simple task much faster than me. Obviously things like this still need to be tested to ensure the code is correct and the link works. However, it is still impressive how much more quickly tasks can be completed, especially for someone with my skill level, with vibe coding.
