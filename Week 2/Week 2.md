# Discussion Week 2 (GRADED)

This is due at the end of the week on **Sunday**. Please read the post in **#msse642-admin** about the philosophy behind the discussions this term. We will discuss this theme in class on Thursday.

Describe your personal programming journey in detail. Tell as much detail as you want, but cover these themes:

### Key Topics to Address

- **Describe a time when you struggled**: Describe a difficult problem or assignment that you had to work out using code, but struggled with making it work. Would an AI programming assistant have helped?

- **Evolution of abstraction levels**: How did your journey reflect moving to "higher levels of abstraction" due to new tools and technology that became available as you progressed through your career? Consider:
  - IDE advancements
  - Frameworks
  - Libraries
  - Syntax correction tools
  - Debugging tools
  - Code generation tools

- **Your experience with Vibe Coding**: What Vibe coding tools do you commonly use and what problems have you encountered with them?

- **Evolution vs. Revolution**: Is Vibe Coding just an extension of previous advancements (IDEs, libraries, etc.) or is it something new? Consider whether it's an evolution or revolution.

I would consider myself still very early in my programming journey. My educational background is in psychology. My current professional field is a combination of IT and telecommunications. Most of the programming I have learned, I have done so on my own using mostly free resources. And then of course the programming assignments in this program. I think my biggest struggle early on was getting down using JavaScript to add functionality to websites. Now, I would say where I struggle is maintaining the momentum working on a project when I run into an issue or get stuck on something.

As I have progressed, I have gotten better at understanding the tools and resources available, like stack overflow, to help work through an issue and resolve it. Additionally, using plugins that help with syntax and predict upcoming words has helped with organizing code and choosing the correct syntax and words for what is trying to be accomplished.

I have started to implement GitHub Copilot in VS Code. I have also used ChatGPT to help with some code. Lastly, I have tried Claude by Anthropic, but have not utilized that tool to the extent of ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. As helpful as these tools are in simplifying and speeding up the process, I do agree with everyone else where it is important for the user to understand enough about coding and developing to be able to confirm and verify the code generated by one of these tools.

I don't know that I would consider vibe coding JUST an extension of previous advancements. Obviously vibe coding does not nullify the need for IDEs, libraries, or frameworks. It adds a new element to these previous advancements. At this stage of vibe coding, I would consider it to be evolutionary. Because AI can still provide code that is incorrect or does not work as expected, it is still important for the developer to have a solid understanding of coding and developing, so that when code generated by AI does not work, the individual knows enough to be able to understand where the mistake is and be able to fix it. Once AI generated code no longer requires confirmation and verification, then it will be revolutionary.
